  "description": "In the state of Colorado, gifted-talented learners are supported by state funding and mandates. Mandates include the development of an advanced learning plan. Technology could better support gifted-talented youth through the existence of a tool which enables the advanced learning plan to be more student-centered. This project is inspired by that need.  This app enables learners to create a JWT enabled environment, create a learner profile, and create a success plan based off of their strengths, interests, and aspirations.  Leaners have access to an indexed history of their created success plans, and can update them at any time.",
