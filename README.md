**Description:**
- In the state of Colorado, gifted-talented learners are supported by state funding and mandates.  Mandates include the development of an advanced learning plan.  Technology could better support gifted-talented youth through the existence of a tool which enables the advanced learning plan to be more student-centered.  This project is inspired by that need.

- The current Advanced Learning Plan process consists of one teacher submitting data digitally while the learner has no access to driving the process.  Align addresses the need for this process to be student-centered and student-driven by empowering the learner to create their own account and success plan.

**Technologies Used:**

Adobe XD, Ruby, Rails, Postgresql, JWT Auth, Angular, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Postman

**User Story:**

- User can create an account, create a success plan, view, update & delete a success plan.  

**Project Planning:**

- Utilized SCRUM strategies with Trello, ZOOM, Slack, Git, & Collegial support
**User Stories:**

**Wireframe:**

**For Future Enhancement:**

- Trello board: https://trello.com/b/IVbKc8oZ/final-project-5-align

**For Future Reference:**

- Build functionality so that user can share a success plan digitally with an adviser, teacher, family member, mentor, etc.

- Build out admin capability (some of it is there and commented out)

- Clear forms upon submit

- Build functionality so that current success plan details can be saved prior to an update

- Add columns to success plan which fully match the Wireframe

- Build out USER crud (code is there but is commented out & it needs to be worked on for full functionality)

- Integrate 3rd party API (charts) for learners to visualize analysis & comparison of progress on success plans.

**Growth & Achievements:**

- Jen Schumann: Bootstrap modals, more Angular JS practice, Adobe XD, 2nd app utilizing Ruby/Rails/Postgresql
